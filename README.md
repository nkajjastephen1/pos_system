## Getting Started

2. Run `npm run dev`

---

## Reports

A new Reports page is available at `/reports`. It lets you generate and preview PDF reports for:

- Daily (today from 00:00 to now)
- Weekly (last 7 days)
- Yearly (last 365 days)

How to use:

1. Install the PDF library if it isn't already installed:

   ```bash
   npm install pdf-lib --save
   ```

2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the app, go to the **Reports** page from the sidebar, and click **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Yearly** to generate a report.
4. A preview modal will appear; you can download the PDF from there.

The PDF includes a header with the store name, the date range, summary metrics (total sales, transactions, tax, average sale), payment method breakdowns, per-product totals, and a transaction list.
